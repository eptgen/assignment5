Run `python train.py --task cls` to train the classification model. Evaluate it by running `python eval_cls.py --load_checkpoint=model_epoch_240` (since it saves up to epoch 240 as it is). The outputted gifs should appear in the `output/` directory. Currently, it runs with a batch size of 32, and saves one gif per batch. For different gifs per batch, offset the batch by some constant between 0 and 31 when setting `i` in `eval.cls.py`.

Run `python eval.py --task seg` to train the segmentation model. Evaluate it by running `python eval_seg.py --load_checkpoint_mode=model_epoch_240 --i={i}`, where `i` is in the set `{382, 224, 608, 311, 386}` (the ones I tested). The outputted gifs should appear in the `output/` directory.

To run the experiments testing model robustness, uncomment the necessary parts of the code in `eval_cls.py` and `eval_seg.py`.
